{"name":"Gradebook","tagline":"A Django-based gradebook backed by the database of your choice.","body":"Gradebook\r\n=========\r\n\r\nA Django-based gradebook backed by the database of your choice\r\n(SQLite3 begin the default)\r\n\r\nCaveats\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis is currently a very early version. I would not recommend using it\r\nfor production purposes. If you do, I suggest backing up your database\r\nafter every major operation. My preference is to use SQLite and send\r\ne-mail an encrypted copy of the database file to myself after every\r\nmajor assignment has been entered.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou must have Django installed. You will also want to have\r\ndjango-zurb-foundation installed (I am using version 5.0.2).\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nUpdate the `settings.py` file as appropriate. If you are using a\r\ndatabase other than SQLite3 you will need to add your database\r\nsettings.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use, for example, PostgreSQL, look at old versions of\r\n`settings.py` to see how I had it configured for local testing.\r\n\r\nIf you are not starting with the example database you will need to\r\ninitialize the database you are using. Navigate to the directory with\r\nthe `manage.py` file and run the command `python manage.py syncdb` after \r\n\r\nRunning\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFrom the gradebook/ directory, run the command `python manage.py\r\nrunserver` to run locally. Then in the browser, go to\r\n<http://localhost:8000/grades/>.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe example database is configured with user `admin` with password\r\n`admin`. If you are using this for anything more than a toy, I suggest\r\nchanging both the username and password via the admin panel (go to\r\n<http://localhost:8000/admin/>, log in, go to the Users section, and\r\nedit the `admin` user to change the name. Use the \"Change Password\"\r\nlink at the top-right to change the password.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under AGPLv3\r\n(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).\r\n\r\nIf you believe you have a compelling reason I should relicense\r\n_portions_ of the application under a different flavor of GNU license\r\n(GPL or LGPL), please feel free to contact me with your rationale.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
